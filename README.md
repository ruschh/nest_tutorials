## How EBRAINS manages Virtual Machines and your Files

1. Go to https://lab.ebrains.eu
1. Choose Germany (Fenix DE - Jülich Supercomputing Center (JSC))
      or Switzerland (Fenix CH - Swiss National Supercomputing Center
      (CSCS)
1. Remember which one you chose
1. Upon "Start Server", EBRAINS spins up a virtual machine (VM) for
   you with 2GB RAM
1. You have a file browser to your left
   - Top level is you local home on the VM—exists as long as the VM
   - `shared` contains long-term storage but needs a *Collab* and is
     not suitable for storing Git repos: **Do not use for now.**
   - `drive` is deprecated, **do not use**.
1. Clone **your fork** of the `nest_tutorials` git repo under the
   "Git" logo in the left margin. There you also find tools for
   managing Git.
1. **Always commit and push at the end of a session.**
1. EBRAINS will from time to time shut down inactive VMs. **Any
   material in your VM home directory will then be lost**—remember to
   push!
1. You can shut down a server yourself via `File > Hub Control
   Panel`. The entire VM including your home on the VM is deleted
   then.
   
### Direct access to the execution sites

If you remember on which site your VM is running, you can contact it
directly

- https://lab.ch.ebrains.eu
- https://lab.de.ebrains.eu

Please **do not** create VMs on both sites simultaneously to avoid
resource waste!


## How NEST Desktop Stores Models

- NEST Desktop stores models as *cookies in your browser*
- Models will disappear when your browser cleans up cookies

| :zap: Always **export your models** to disk for safe storage |
